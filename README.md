# FCN-Segmentation
To segment cell nuclei from histology images, I decided to use Fully Convolutional networks. I had experiences in medical images segmentation but a deep learning based approach was new to me! So, I decided to start with a basic DL based segmentation and I found FCN easy and straightforward for the task. <br/>
During the implementation, I used the material and explanations provided in the following webpage:
https://fairyonice.github.io/Learn-about-Fully-Convolutional-Networks-for-semantic-segmentation.html
In order to train and test the models faster I used a smaller subset of the provided data in development phase, which 6 images used for training and 1 for validation. This subset used for tune the DL parameters. <br/>
My first attempt using FCN-8 [1] wasnâ€™t much promising. The final segmented region is shown bellow. Left shows the input imagge, right is the segmented image, and the ground truth is shown in the middle.

I realized the pixelated effect that happens in the segmented region is mostly due to the up-sampling with factor of 8 occurring using the inverse convolution layer. So, I thought maybe using skip connections after finer resolutions (i.e., first and second pooling layers), might help to preserve the details in the boundary of the objects. So, the second attempt was to include these connections to the original FCN-8 as shown below.

As can be seen the up-sampling is done by a factor of 2 instead of 8. This network provided much better performance by preserving the details in the object boundary. The result on the same testing sample is as follow
